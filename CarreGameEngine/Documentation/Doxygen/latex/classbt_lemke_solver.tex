\subsection{Detailed Description}
original version written by Erwin Coumans, October 2013 

The \hyperlink{classbt_lemke_solver}{btLemkeSolver} is based on \char`\"{}Fast Implementation of Lemke’s Algorithm for Rigid Body Contact Simulation (John E. Lloyd) \char`\"{} It is a slower but more accurate solver. Increase the m\_\-maxLoops for better convergence, at the cost of more CPU time. The original implementation of the btLemkeAlgorithm was done by Kilian Grundl from the MBSim team
