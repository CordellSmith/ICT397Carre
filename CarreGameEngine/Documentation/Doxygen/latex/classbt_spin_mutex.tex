\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{classbt_spin_mutex}{btSpinMutex} -- lightweight spin-mutex implemented with atomic ops, never puts a thread to sleep because it is designed to be used with a task scheduler which has one thread per core and the threads don't sleep until they run out of tasks. Not good for general purpose use.
