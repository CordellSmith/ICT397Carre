\subsection{Detailed Description}
The \hyperlink{structb3_dynamic_bvh_broadphase}{b3DynamicBvhBroadphase} implements a broadphase using two dynamic AABB bounding volume hierarchies/trees (see \hyperlink{structb3_dynamic_bvh}{b3DynamicBvh}). One tree is used for static/non-moving objects, and another tree is used for dynamic objects. Objects can move from one tree to the other. This is a very fast broadphase, especially for very dynamic worlds where many objects are moving. Its insert/add and remove of objects is generally faster than the sweep and prune broadphases b3AxisSweep3 and b332BitAxisSweep3.

this setAabbForceUpdate is similar to setAabb but always forces the aabb update. it is not part of the b3BroadphaseInterface but specific to \hyperlink{structb3_dynamic_bvh_broadphase}{b3DynamicBvhBroadphase}. it bypasses certain optimizations that prevent aabb updates (when the aabb shrinks), see \href{http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=223}{\tt http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=223}
